            <p>Being amongst the Australian political sphere can be exhausting at times.</p>
            <p>The overwhelming guilt and shame which lingers around politicians like a toxic gas make our leaders reek of self-hatred and weakness.</p>
            <p>While countries around the world wave their flags in patriotism, our pollies are crying in the corner, trying to keep track of how many times they’ve said “sorry” for Australia’s past and how many times they will need to say it in the future.</p>
            <p>The fake intellectualism involved with reviewing every misstep in history constantly with a microscope only dooms our nation further.</p>
            <p>While the rest of the western world flees from enshrining race-based policies into their nation, Australian politicians have spun in circles so many times in confusion, they think they should return to it.</p>

            <p>“The Voice” proposition has been widely unpopular with Australians, at the time of writing this, over 50% of Australians are planning to outright vote no according to significant national polls.</p>
            <p>As it turns out, trying to make the case that a small high-class bureaucratic government committee should be able to speak for ALL Indigenous people comes off HIGHLY racist.</p>
            <p>That’s because it is racist.</p>
            <p>Albanese’s undercooked idea is a result of his obsession with being known as a leader in “social justice,” not in actually making a difference.</p>
            <p>If he was concerned with actually making a difference, the people suffering in places like Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, and Cunnamulla would be a lot better off.</p>
            <p>Indigenous individuals obviously can not be spoken for by a small government committee, and this obviously takes us back instead of forward.</p>
            <p>Australia knows this.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately for Australians though, the leader of the Liberal Party, Peter Dutton as well as the leader of the Nationals Party, David Littleproud are hellbent on creating division along with Labor, not easing tensions.</p>
            <p>Dutton has committed to a second referendum if Albanese’s were to fail regarding a race-based voice, with Littleproud claiming their party had been there for “some time.”</p>
            <p>This is an incredibly dangerous couple of shots in their own feet, as everyday Australians voting no may now feel compelled to vote yes so to not be met with more referendum division down the road.</p>
            <p>If the “No” vote is to make it now, it will be DESPITE Littleproud and Dutton’s incompetence, and it’s a damn shame.</p>
            <p>A race-based change IS NOT the alternative Australians want to an unpopular race-based change.</p>
            <p>Dutton and Littleproud have proven themselves to be unfit leaders.</p>
            <p>They continually swipe at their own coalition.</p>
            <p>When Scott Morrison navigated the COVID lockdown maniacs and tried to keep the country afloat during difficult times despite the persistence from state governments to lock down Australia and harm our economy, he was not appropriately supported.</p>
            <p>Then after primarily Leftist governments oppressed Australians by locking them in their homes for no good reason and completely violated their constitutional rights, it was Morrison that Littleproud took swings at for his ministry decisions which were totally thrown out of proportion and relatively harmless.</p>
            <p>When Littleproud swiped at Morrison instead at taking aim at the people who violated our rights, he harshly damaged the chances of the coalition getting into government anytime soon.</p>
            <p>The two need to step down and let real leaders take charge.</p>
