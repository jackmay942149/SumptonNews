            <p>Key members of regional Australia have called for action on crime in North Queensland’s busiest city, Townsville. </p>
            <p>Hinchinbrook MP, Nick Dametto spoke on Katter’s Australian Party’s latest billboard which calls to “Make Townsville safe again.”</p>
            <p>Mr Dametto said the billboard’s primary objective was to promote the KAP’s policy on relocation sentencing.</p>
            <p>“Here at KAP, we’ve been working on Relocation Sentencing for a long time to formulate what we see as the blueprint for a new sentencing option,” he said.</p>
            <p>“Last week we delivered the policy to every Minister, Shadow Minister and Member of the crossbench.</p>
            <p>“After last week’s major policy launch, we have been contacted by people across the State who say they agree and back our policy 100 per cent.</p>
            <p>“We are grateful for the support because it was from the community that this policy was born.</p>

        <div class="article_text">
            <p>“We would like to see both the Government and Opposition put victims first and get serious about rehabilitating youth offenders by backing this policy.</p>
            <p>“Growing community and political support is only happening because of the backing this solution has by the people.</p>
            <p>“Victims of crime are frustrated and fed up with the Palaszczuk Government for their failed efforts to address youth crime and their blatant disregard for Queenslander’s right to be safe.</p>
            <p>“Put yourself in the shoes of the victims here, in many cases, knowing that the young criminals who just held up their shop at knife point, or stole and burnt their car, or ransacked their house, are most likely to be back out on the streets in a number of hours after being apprehend by policy under the current youth justice system.”</p>
            <p>The full KAP policy can be found <a href="https://kap.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/KAP-Relocation-Sentencing-Policy-2.pdf">here</a></p>
