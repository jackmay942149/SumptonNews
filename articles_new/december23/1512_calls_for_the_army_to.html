        <h1>Calls for the army to take action in Townsville</h1>

        <img src="/branding/breaking_news.JPG">

        <div class="article_text">
        
            <p>Amid Townsville’s youth crime crisis, Katter’s Australian Party Deputy Leader Nick Dametto has called for Australia’s Defence Minister to utilise defense force assistance in the city.</p>
            <p>Mr Dametto said he hoped the military skills and equipment could assist the Queensland Police Service to carry out their duties safely and effectively.</p>
            <p>“The community is completely fed up with the crime that is taking place across Townsville,” he said.</p>
            <p>“The offending rate is on the rise as is the frequency and severity of the violence.</p>
            <p>“Residents have drawn the line after emergency service vehicles including ambulances have now become a target for youth joy riding in stolen cars..</p>
            <p>“This call has come from Townsville residents who have been asking what it would take for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to become involved.</p>
            <p>“I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister, the Hon. Richard Marles on the thirteenth of December to ask that very question.</p>
            <p>“We live in a garrison city with ADF resources at our fingertips that could be used in the short term to aid and assist police in their plight to control and disrupt youth crime gangs in Townsville.”</p>

            <p>According to Mr Dametto, under section 35(1)(a) of the Defence Act 1903 (Cth), the State Government may apply to the Commonwealth Government to protect the state against domestic violence and this power actually lies within our Australian Constitution.</p>
            <p>Mr Dametto also said he was looking forward to the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister’s prompt response.”</p>
