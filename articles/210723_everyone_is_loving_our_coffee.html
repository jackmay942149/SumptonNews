            <h4>Originally published for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Coffee enthusiasts have been enjoying their time at the newly opened Basalt Pool House, according to the Facility Manager at the Kennedy Regiment Memorial Pool Tracy Maff.</p>
            <p>Mrs Maff said The Basalt Pool House on 7-13 Plummer Street, managed by ATM Aquatics has been frequented by happy customers.</p>
            <p>“Reception has been really, really positive,” she said.</p>
            <p>“They're loving that I brought plants into the space, and I love that because that makes me feel like it's more of a warm homely kind of space.</p>
            <p>“If they love that then I'm really happy.</p>
            <p>“That was one of the first things I had on my list in my business plan, was to beautify the space.</p>
            <p>“And that includes, you know, little bits of furniture but that makes all the difference for someone coming to hang out here that's not necessarily using the water, but wanting to come into a nice clean space to hang out.</p>
            <p>“That's been really positive.</p>
            <p>“Everyone is loving our coffee which is awesome.”</p>
            <p>Mrs Maff also said the cafe is open to the local community reaching out.</p>
            <p>“We're just obviously finding our way as we move through it and seeing what works, but definitely open to feedback,” she said.</p>
