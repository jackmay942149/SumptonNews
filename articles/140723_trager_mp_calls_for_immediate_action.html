        <div class="article_text">
            <p>Katter’s Australian Party leader and Traeger MP Robbie Katter has called for action on Mount Isa youth crime after a tragic incident.</p>
            <p>Mr Katter said he was advised shortly after he flew into his home town yesterday a vehicle had spent the morning targeting civilians across town.</p>
            <p>“I have had numerous calls and complaints advising me that this stolen vehicle has been deliberately trying to ram people,” Mr Katter said. </p>
            <p>“I have been made aware that multiple local schools this morning have gone into lockdown over the incident.</p>
            <p>“It is also alleged that a member of staff, on foot, at a local school was rammed, whilst other staff members hid.</p>
            <p>“I am also led to believe that a student was on a local field and chased by the car, extremely fortunate to escape without injury.”</p>

            <p>Mr Katter urged for the state government to take action on youth crime following the situation.</p>
            <p>“I am calling for immediate action on the youth crime issues that continue to plague our state,” said Mr Katter.</p>
            <p>“These kids on a morning joyride need and deserve real consequences.</p>
            <p>“Again, the KAP and I call for alternative sentencing to deliver said consequences.</p>
            <p>“We believe that our Relocation Sentencing Policy is the government's best shot at regaining some control and combating the state's youth crime crisis.</p>
            <p>“How much longer will the state government continue to turn a blind eye to the issue?</p>
            <p>“How many more events such as this do we have to endure before something is done?”</p>
