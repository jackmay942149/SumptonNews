            <p>Local excitement has ramped up for the Charters Towers Goldfield Ashes as the amateur cricket carnival has arrived.</p>
            <p>The event conducted by the Charters Towers Cricket Association Incorporated will take place from the 20th of January to the 22nd of January.</p>
            <p>The iconic Charters Towers Cafe, Koffe & Cones have set up a front window display with Goldfield Ashes decorations in anticipation for the event.</p>
            <p>Koffe and Cones owner, Donna Croker said people have loved observing the front window displays.</p>
            <p>“My Mum (Betty Croker) does the displays, I just get in there and put things where she wants them and it’s really just about getting into the community spirit,” she said.</p>
            <p>“A lot of people enjoy seeing the displays.”</p>
            <p>The famed Cafe owner also said she was excited for the economic boost the Ashes could bring.</p>
            <p>“The Ashes bring a lot of extra people to town which then boosts the local economy,” she said.</p>
            <p>“It’s also great to see people having fun and the outfits that the teams have.”</p>
            <p>Goldfield Ashes Organiser, Kerri Forno said she hoped for clear skies during the event.</p>
            <p>"The Committee are very excited about this Carnival and hope that we have clear skies so that we can play all three days of cricket,” she said.</p>
