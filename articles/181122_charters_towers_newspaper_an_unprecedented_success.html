            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 18/11/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>The Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton’s Gold Rush Gazette has shown to be a huge success according to the publication’s founder, Daniel Sumpton.</p>
            <p>Mr Sumpton said he is overjoyed the news publication has brought massive exposure to local businesses and is on a trajectory to grow much larger.</p>
            <p>“A lot of people forget we were a magazine for a full year before we transformed into a newspaper, so we have been successfully communicating how great it is to be in Charters</p>
            <p>Towers and among local businesses to investors all over the world for some time now,” he said.</p>
            <p>“The transformation to a newspaper that the current owner and editor, Xander Townsend, overlooked after I established the magazine has just elevated the publication to such profound new heights.</p>
            <p>“We are absolutely dominating as a rural publication in getting our news to people across the country, and ofcourse, we still have investors from other nations tuning into Charters Towers.”</p>
            <p>Mr Sumpton predicted businesses who don’t get on board and collaborate with the Charters Towers newspaper will be missing out.</p>
            <p>“Some of the larger businesses and chain retailers have shown a laughable bias toward other failing Murdoch papers in the region and why you would want to distribute or advertise with companies that have shrunk in many areas and spread misinformation over one that is growing and has the most reliable news for Charters Towers escapes me.</p>
            <p>“Maybe the larger chain retailers would rather go down with old sinking ships than team up with freshly built rockets going straight toward the moon.”</p>
            <p>There is a new way to find information about the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton’s Gold Rush Gazette online, simply go to <a href="http://www.charterstowersnewspaper.com">www.charterstowersnewspaper.com</a> to learn more about the publication.</p>
