            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 14/04/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Charters Towers Mayor Frank Beveridge said everyone has been enjoying the Water Park and assured locals the facility will continue to be carefully monitored.</p>
            <p>Mr Beveridge said the facility has been frequently used for get togethers.</p>
            <p>“Everyone is enjoying it,” he said.</p>
            <p>“It's been very, very well used.</p>
            <p>“There have been some behaviour issues with some problem people, but that's only in the minority, that was for a couple of weekends so that's died down at the moment.</p>
            <p>“It has been a very big hit as we’ve said, there's been parties there nearly every weekend and people using it.</p>
            <p>“We just encourage everyone to have parental supervision down there to keep the children safe.”</p>
            <p>Mr Beveridge detailed the work involved with monitoring of the Charters Towers Water Park.</p>
            <p>“We have had a number of security people driving past and we always have it on the police radar site as you would with a brand new facility because you're always worried about vandalism, so we are keeping a close eye on it,” he said.</p>
