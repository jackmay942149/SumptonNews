            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 17/3/23 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>KAP leader Robbie Katter has called for action as graffiti spreads throughout Charters Towers.</p>
            <p>Mr Katter said government complacency has allowed deterioration and damage to heritage listed buildings by youth offenders.</p>
            <p>“These heritage listed buildings around town are the cultural spirit of Charters Towers, and this type of disregard for them cuts deep,” he said.</p>
            <p>“Charters Towers has largely been buffered from the terribly high crime rates that are being experienced in Townsville and Mount Isa, however as government complacency allows further deterioration of these issues, it does not surprise me that such issues are oozing into our smaller towns.</p>
            <p>“The anger that derives from these unresolved youth crime issues continues to drive frustration into communities such as Charters Towers.</p>
            <p>“The risk we are currently running is that this behaviour becomes normalised.”</p>
            <p>Mr Katter also said the KAP has a detailed plan to stamp out growing crime by youths.</p>
            <p>“The KAP remain focused on attacking the core drivers of these problems,” he said.</p>
            <p>“The key solutions from the KAP still remain, principally pushing for our relocation sentencing policy that will provide adequate consequences, combined with minimum penalties, and longer sentences.</p>
            <p>“These solutions we believe will provide real consequences and allow rehabilitation of these offenders allowing them to become active members of society.”</p>
            <p>Founder of Sumpton’s Gold Rush Gazette Daniel Sumpton said he was sick of seeing graffiti around Charters Towers.</p>
            <p>“These signs of degeneracy are everywhere now,” he said.</p>
            <p>“Youth crime is out of control and their tags are ugly.</p>
            <p>“Make our town beautiful again.”</p>
