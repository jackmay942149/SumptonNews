            <p>The Mount Isa City Council has adopted its 2023-27 Mount Isa Youth Strategy, which establishes a framework and actions to set up local young people for future success.</p>
            <p>The Youth Strategy includes the blueprints for a local Youth Council and youth action group and has a focus on representing the specific strengths and needs of First Nations young people.</p>
            <p>The Youth Strategy aims to bring together the voices and aspirations of young people and those directly involved with young people, and encompasses key aspects of education, recreation, employment, and mental wellbeing.</p>
            <p>Its recommendations include establishing a dedicated Youth Development role with Council, increasing programs for young people, establishing a multi-purpose youth precinct, developing a community safety plan, establishing a 24-hour safe space facility for young people to hang out, and more. </p>

            <p>For young people, the Youth Council is designed to develop a better understanding of the role and function of local government, the community, and local issues; enable them to discuss community issues; provide input into Council planning, programs and services, and influence local government decision-making processes; provide leadership development opportunities; and help participants develop job-ready skills such as teamwork, public speaking, time management, organisation, negotiation and communication.</p>
            <p>The youth action group aims to empower young people to have a voice and contribute to the future of the Mount Isa region.</p>
            <p>Its members are proposed to include a Councillor, Councilâ€™s Youth Development Officer, community leaders, First Nations Elders or their nominees, and young people from schools, the wider community, and First Nations young people, and its focus will be hearing and responding to the voices of local young people.</p>
            <p>In developing the strategy, consultants the Atria Group earlier this year undertook extensive consultation with Mount Isa organisations, community groups, and members of the public involved in services that support youths.</p>
