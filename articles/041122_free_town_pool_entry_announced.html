            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 04/11/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>The Charters Towers Regional Council are offering free entry into the Kennedy Regiment Memorial Pool through the Christmas school holiday due to water park delays.</p>
            <p>Charters Towers Mayor, Frank Beveridge said the iconic town pool will be free to enter 7 days a week between from 9am to midday through the Christmas holiday for schools as compensation for water park delays caused by labour shortages.</p>
            <p>“Significant progress has been made on the Charters Towers Water Park with an anticipated opening date early in the New Year,” he said.</p>
            <p>“The building is up, the big gear is on site, including the play equipment and the underground work all done.</p>
            <p>“The Water Park is starting to take shape.”</p>
            <p>Mr Beveridge said every effort is being made by the contractors to open the facility as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The highly anticipated and praised water park will finish construction on Council land in Water Street.</p>
