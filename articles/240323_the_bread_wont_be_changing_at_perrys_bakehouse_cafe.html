            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 24/03/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Greg and Melanie Perry are handing over the reins to the locally cherished institution Perry’s Bakehouse Cafe after nine years.</p>
            <p>Stewart and Bekky Burnside will be taking over Perry’s Bakehouse Cafe in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>Melanie Perry said she was excited to see how the bakery is taken into the future.</p>
            <p>“There’s so much potential with that shop, in the area and so many things you could do with it,” she said.</p>
            <p>“We powered on and we started the shop from nothing and now it's time to hand it on to somebody else.</p>
            <p>“Bekky can power on and have her turn, making it even more successful.”</p>
            <p>Greg Perry said out of all the things that could be changed about the famous bakery, the bread won’t be one of them. </p>
            <p>“I think one thing we can be assured of is that the bread won't be changing,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We have not asked too much of Bekky’s plans because they’re for her to decide.</p>
            <p>“She said there will be some changes but I would imagine that the majority of things will stay the same.”</p>
            <p>Mr Perry also said that his family was blown away by the support from Charters Towers locals over the years.</p>
            <p>“We would just like to say thank you so very much for your support,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We did not know what to expect when we opened the bakery and we were just blown away from day one by the support from the Charters Towers people.”</p>
