            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 10/03/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Charters Towers beekeeper, Nick Phillips, 17, has an outline for the future of his business to benefit all local honey enthusiasts.</p>
            <p>Mr Phillips said his honey can already be found at markets in town and he has big plans for expanding further.</p>
            <p>“Currently I just do it in person but it's at the Sunday markets or any type of markets that are in Charters Towers, that’s where people can access it,” he said.</p>
            <p>“I'm hoping to expand to have more hives and maybe have an actual business name and a website that people can purchase it from and a number that they can ring me on.”</p>
            <p>Mr Phillips told the story of how he became a successful local beekeeper.</p>
            <p>“My brother used to do a lot, he came home and talked about it a bit and we found that granddad had a 40 year old hive," he said.</p>
            <p>“We took it to a man called Ray Wilkinson and he started us up.</p>
            <p>“He transferred some brood frames, some honey frames from his nuc box into our little brood box, and then we brought it home so we set it up.</p>
            <p>“Then it expanded over a couple of months and then we started making hives.</p>
            <p>“We bought some more hives and then made more hives with it so now we're at where we are today.”</p>
