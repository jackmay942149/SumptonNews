            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 09/06/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Prominent locals Peter and Joy O’Keefe announced the closure of Charters Towers Indoor Sports after 36 years.</p>
            <p>Owner and manager Mr O’Keefe said it was a privilege to run Charters Towers Indoor Sports for such a long period of time.</p>
            <p>“I'm gonna miss this more than anyone,” he said.</p>
            <p>“It'll get to me, I'll miss it. </p>
            <p>“They're all like family and even last night, a couple of girls were crying here, they’ve been playing for 20 odd years.</p>
            <p>“I come to work, get a beer, and talk to people.</p>
            <p>“You can’t do that anywhere else.</p>
            <p>“It’s the best job going.”</p>
            <p>The last ever Indoor Sports Finals at the centre were hosted on the 2nd and 3rd of June.</p>
            <p>Mr O’Keefe also said the decision to close the facility was difficult.</p>
            <p>“It was hard to make the decision but we can't stay here forever sort of thing,” he said.</p>
            <p>“It's good to do something different for a while, try it, see what it’s like anyway.</p>
            <p>“I've been a nervous wreck the last week.”</p>
            <p>Mr O’Keefe thanked the hardworking locals who have helped out over the years.</p>
            <p>“We've had really good staff working here,” he said.</p>
            <p>“There was one lady here, Jenny Logan, she was here for bloody 10 to 15 years.</p>
            <p>“We've had umpires and like even Tim the cook, he's been cooking sausages for the last probably 10 years.</p>
            <p>“And we've had good sponsors.</p>
            <p>“Choice Meats gives us our snags every Friday night, things like that.</p>
            <p>“There's a thousand people to thank, but you just don't know where to start.”</p>
