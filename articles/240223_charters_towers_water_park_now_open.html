            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 24/02/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>The highly anticipated Charters Towers Water Park officially opened on the 18th of February to the local community.</p>
            <p>The facility on Water Street experienced delays due to worker shortages but is now fully operable.</p>
            <p>Councillor Kate Hastie said the grand opening of the Charters Towers Water Park was a huge success.</p>
            <p>“It was a wonderful morning at the official opening of the Water Park,” she said.</p>
            <p>“The sheer delight on littlies faces was fantastic to see and the shrieks of excitement was something I won't forget in a hurry.</p>
            <p>“This facility is sure to be enjoyed by many for years to come.</p>
            <p>“I'd like to thank all Council staff and vendors on the day who helped make this event such a success.”</p>
            <p>The project was funded through both the State Government’s Works for Queensland Program and the Australian Government’s Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program.</p>
            <p>Ongoing maintenance will be funded through Council operations.</p>
