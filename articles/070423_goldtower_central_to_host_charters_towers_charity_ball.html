            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 07/04/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Charters Towers Charity Ball will have a new home this year, with Goldtower Central hosting the event at their newest building, Poppet Head Plaza.</p>
            <p>Goldtower is the naming rights sponsor for the event, which is scheduled to be held on 12th August later this year.</p>
            <p>This collaboration will take place in the newly developed precinct’s function and events space that covers over 1,200 sqm in size.</p>
            <p>The event will mark a significant milestone as the first major function to be held at Poppet Head Plaza.</p>
            <p>Goldtower Central Owner and Founder Paul McIver said he was excited to welcome the community into this new space.</p>
            <p>"We are thrilled to be hosting this year's Charity Ball in our newly developed function space at Goldtower Central,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We can't wait to showcase the versatility and elegance of our events space to the Charters Towers community.</p>
            <p>“We are proud to be given the opportunity to support a local event.</p>
            <p>“Without sponsorship, events like this wouldn’t be able to happen, we all have our roles to play."</p>
            <p>The 2023 funding recipient for the Havana Nights themed event is Ronald McDonald House Charities, North Australia.</p>
            <p>The proceeds will be directly going to upgrade the family room, located at Townsville Hospital.</p>
            <p>Tickets go on sale Sunday, 18 June 2023 from 9:00am.</p>
