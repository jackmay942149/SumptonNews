            <p>Charters Towers Gold City Realty principal, Tarja Barnes was a finalist for residential salesperson of the year at the REIQ Awards for Excellence 2022.</p>
            <p>Since the winners of the REIQ Awards for Excellence 2022 were announced late last month, local praise has been given to Ms Barnes for her hard work which led to being nominated.</p>
            <p>Charters Towers local Caitlin Mitchell said the nomination was a noteworthy achievement.</p>
            <p>"It is such a massive milestone to be selected from the large amount of nominations that are received by REIQ,” she said.</p>
            <p>“I thought that this was a remarkable achievement by Tarja Barnes and her team at Gold City Realty.”</p>
            <p>The nomination is highly prestigious as the REIQ is the peak body representing real estate professionals across Queensland.</p>
            <p>Ms Barnes said she was overjoyed to be recognised for her work.</p>
            <p>“It is a giant honour just to be nominated amongst some large competitors in the industry,” she said.</p>
