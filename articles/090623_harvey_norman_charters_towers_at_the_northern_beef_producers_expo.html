            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 01/01/2001 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Harvey Norman Charters Towers attended the seventh Northern Beef Producers Expo at the H.M. Clarke Saleywards and Equestrian Centre on Friday the 2nd and Saturday the 3rd of June 2023.</p>
            <p>They showcased their drones, DashCams, Security Cameras, and more for those in outback Queensland!</p>

            <p><b>Statement from  Harvey Norman Charters Towers Entertainment and Technology Proprietor, Jackie Ryan:</b></p>
            <p><em>At the Harvey Norman Charters Towers Computers and IT Department we not only offer the standard run of the mill type products that you have come to expect like phones, dash cams, laptops, desktops, printers, and computer software etc.  Here in Charters Towers, we offer so much more.</em></p>
            <p><em>I was raised on the land and felt the need to diversify my business to accommodate the needs of the ever-changing agricultural industry.  The next generation grazier sprang to mind so I included a range of drones in my store that can provide the answers and support to this industry.  We can supply mapping drones to map and record images of weeds, tank levels, floodgates and everything in between.  There is also a thermal range which can assist with feral animal control and the detection of cattle in dense scrubland.  Then there is the mother of them all, the T30 drone which has a spray tank capacity of 30 litres.  This spray drone can also be adapted to a seed and a fertiliser spreader with the carrying capacity of 40 kgs.  This drone is a real break through in hard to access land such as around swamps and along rivers, with it, drift wastage is minimal, and the cost of expensive poison is kept to a minimum.</em></p>
            <p><em>We also stock the stand-alone solar security cameras to keep an eye out on your roads for intruders and any unwanted visitors which might cause grief to your operations.  These breakthrough cameras operate with an SD card and are sim card compatible which can provide their own network so these can be used anywhere. These images and alerts can be beamed back to your phone and the image will be captured on the SD card to give to authorities.  No need any more to wonder who left the gate open or killed that fat bullock.</em></p>
            <p><em>It does not stop there to help the graziers, we also stock a full range of the revolutionary EcoFlow    Lithium-Ion Battery Generators.  No more packing the heavy generator and fuel and oil and hoping the petrol genny will run your welder and grinder in the paddock take the EcoFlow.  Easily recharged with a solar panel, no fumes no noise no fuss.</em></p>
            <p><em>I will continue to offer my support and expand my range of products to suit the demand of the people in the bush.  “If you want it, I will do my best to source it,  it’s my promise to the bush.”</em></p>
