            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 28/10/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Michael ‘Mick’ Bethel has opened up about his business Texas Longhorn Tours winning Best Tour and Attraction at the 2022 NQ Tourism and Events Awards.</p>
            <p>The NQ Tourism and Events Awards was hosted by the Townsville Enterprise on October 14.</p>
            <p>Mr Bethel said he was grateful for the people who voted for the Texas Longhorn Tours.</p>
            <p>“It means a lot, it's not about the winning,” he said.</p>
            <p>“After the award was announced, I said the same thing last year from memory, it's not about us, it's about the people who voted for us.</p>
            <p>“They chose us, and we can only succeed if people choose to vote for us so we devote it to them.”</p>
            <p>Mr Bethel thanked his wife Lynda Bethel for all her effort.</p>
            <p>“I'd like to thank Lynda, we are very much a team effort and everyone knows us as a team,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We have our strengths and weaknesses but we go hard in the areas that we are good at and we work really well together.</p>
            <p>“She keeps the whole thing together, it used to be a mum and dad show but now I tell everyone it is a grandma and grandad show.”</p>
            <p>Herveys Range Heritage Tea Rooms and Sunset on Towers Hill Tours were also finalists and Kernow Charters Towers was the runner up for the accommodation award.</p>
