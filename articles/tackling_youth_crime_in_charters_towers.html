            <h4><em>Daniel Sumpton</em> - Originally published on 3/3/23 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>The keys to lowering youth crime have been consistent throughout all of recorded history. Kids who are happy, occupied, family-oriented, and principled will (obviously) be less likely to injure, murder, abuse, or steal from members of their community. Katter’s Australian Party’s proposal for relocation sentencing to become commonplace for youths who have committed crimes is highly important to advocate for. The KAP website details the plan by stating, “Magistrates would be able to send offenders to a remote, approved property. They would work on the land to learn life skills and become better society members.” While this is a great plan for those who have committed crimes, we need to analyse and address the problems that are causing the youth to offend more frequently in the first place.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the most obvious solution is something that we cannot simply put into effect and measure the results of with one brushstroke. Children who are deprived from learning the value of being principled, having love of country, and from religion are becoming increasingly bitter and prone to committing crimes. After all, if you are oblivious to the value of western society, why you should be proud to protect where you live and the fact that there is an objective moral compass, all that's left is chaos. In a world of chaos, a child is only encouraged to be chaotic. Parents who have deprived their children of valuable knowledge under the umbrella of “letting the child choose what they value,” have forgotten a key to healthy young societies which is that “Children need guidance.” While the ship has long sailed away for at least for a couple generations of raising all children to care about their community, country, and moral compass, there are still things that can be done.</p>
            <p style="text-decoration: underline">What more can be done about youth crime?</p>
            <p>While we cannot wave a wand and teach all children about values, we can get pretty close to it. Government funded facilities which provide supervised availability to activities children take joy from but may not be able to afford such as sports, video games, streaming services, Kindles, and other recreational resources run by experts in building character outside of school hours is a simple way to remove the boredom that leads to reckless behaviour as well as giving kids opportunities to learn about the value of responsibility from people who genuinely care. Kids need to have a place to go for comfort while also being in the presence of a sensible adult who won’t let them act out and is happy to teach the value of responsibility. Instead of the school’s job of learning the fundamentals, it would be a facility that puts putting fundamental knowledge into effect as paramount. It would be led by people who have the freedom to learn the ambitions of the children and help them put a plan into effect for becoming successful in those aspirations. They would also learn generally about responsibility. For example, the facility would be free for kids to come and use the resources within the premises on the condition that they subscribed to a certain time of day in the week where they would listen and learn about a course on responsibility.</p>
            <p style="text-decoration: underline;">What can WE do?</p>
            <p>Beyond the government and suggesting plans for facilities they should help put into place to protect our society, there is also a very important thing we as the Charters Towers community can do to protect our loved ones and neighbours. Putting a town-wide “neighbourhood watch” in place is simple and something we can coordinate together. With a combination of community members walking the streets and people in houses put on watch at certain hours, we could make the town more safe by alerting the community of unusual activity through a social media page. From that point, we could create a roadmap with areas of unusual or antisocial activity and more heavily monitor those areas. If you are interested in starting an initiative such as this alongside me, please reach out.</p>
