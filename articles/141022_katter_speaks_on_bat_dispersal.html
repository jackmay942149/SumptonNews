            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 14/10/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Katter’s Australian Party Leader, Robbie Katter reacted to the dispersal of the bat colony from Lissner Park which commenced on Wednesday, October 5, 2022.</p>
            <p>External contractor, Biodiversity Australia, has been hired by the Charters Towers Regional Council to relocate the bat colony over a two to four week period from the initial start date.</p>
            <p>Mr Katter said he pushed for Biodiversity Australia to be used in the dispersal. </p>
            <p>“I was the one that put Biodiversity on the table about 4 years ago saying ‘well you need someone who can actually move the bats, there's no point in just building a park’,” Mr Katter said. </p>
            <p>Mr Katter also said the job was only halfway done.</p>
            <p>“They are not out of town yet so we are only halfway through the job but everything is going really well,” he said.</p>
            <p>“I’m not surprised because that's what happens, it's the first time ever we have had professionals that know what they are doing.”</p>
            <p>Mr Katter expressed praise for Biodiversity Australia’s commitment to the dispersal.</p>
            <p>“They (Biodiversity Australia) are really just guys and they are just committed to trying to do a good job, so I'm really happy they are there,” he said.</p>
