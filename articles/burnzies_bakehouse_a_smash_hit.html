            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 21/04/23 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Co-owners of Burnzies Bakehouse, Stewart and Bekky Burnside, started successfully operating as usual in early April after their acquisition of the famous bakery spot.</p>
            <p>Mrs Burside said the experience of running Burnzies Bakehouse, formerly Perry’s Bakehouse Cafe, has been gratifying.</p>
            <p>“It’s been amazing,” she said.</p>
            <p>“We can’t believe just how busy it's been.”</p>
            <p>Mrs Burnside also said the response to their new items available have been positive.</p>
            <p>“The donuts are probably the big main thing, the town hasn’t had that before and the response that we’ve had for the donuts has been massive,” she said.</p>
            <p>The bakehouse is open from 5am to 2pm on weekdays and from 6am to 2pm on weekends.</p>
            <p>Mr Burnside said much like the owners of Perry’s Bakehouse Cafe, the newly acquired establishment will support locals.</p>
            <p>“We are looking forward to supporting the community too, the same as Mel and Greg used to,” he said.</p>
            <p>“We want to continue the sponsorships.”</p>
