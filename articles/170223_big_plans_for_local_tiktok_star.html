            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 17/02/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Viral TikTok renovator Nat Redgrave has big plans for the restoration of another Charters Towers property.</p>
            <p>Mr Redgrave received unprecedented attention last year on the short-form video hosting service TikTok for renovating a Charters Towers property labelled a “crack den.”</p>
            <p>The TikTok renovator said he now plans to turn a rat infested miner’s cottage into a luxury farmhouse.</p>
            <p>“It was just trash, rat infested, nothing inside, just a disgrace, and I kind of wanted it to be a luxury, original farmhouse, because it was built in 1920 as a miner's cottage,” he said.</p>
            <p>Mr Redgrave said the miner’s cottage he is currently renovating has taken a lot more effort and higher costs.</p>
            <p>“The first one was an in depth renovation but we definitely didn't go as far in renovation costs,” he said.</p>
            <p>“This one's double the cost in the renovation because it's so high end and we did so much work.”</p>
            <p>Mr Redgrave discussed his experiences with online negativity and hate as a result of becoming a successful social media star known for his in-depth renovations. </p>
            <p>“It seems to be that in this region, there's a lot of people trying to bring others down and all that kind of stuff,” he said.</p>
            <p>“No one will own up to it, but you don't have to go to detective school to work out where it's coming from.</p>
            <p>“You've got one person that's harassing you, incessantly driving past and making snide remarks.</p>
            <p>"It's pretty easy to work out where the other stuff is going to be coming from because where there's smoke, there's fire, but we wake up each day and we don't worry about that because if they want to focus all their energy and hate on harassing us, go for it.</p>
            <p>“That's like drinking poison and hoping it kills the other person.</p>
            <p>"They can sit there and focus all their negativity or hate on us, we don't focus it on them.</p>
            <p>“We've got other stuff to do, we're trying to renovate a house so if people want to sit there and hate on us, that's on them.</p>
            <p>“We just come here and try and do the best we can.</p>
            <p>“And we've spent over $300,000 in the Charters Towers region since we've been here with local businesses.”</p>
            <p>The viral social media star known for his high quality renovations can be found as @natredgrave on TikTok.</p>
