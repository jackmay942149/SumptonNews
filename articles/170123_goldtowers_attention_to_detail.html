            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 27/01/2023 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Executive Director of Goldtower Central, Paul McIver has discussed the high attention to detail involved with the construction of the commercial precinct in an exclusive interview.</p>
            <p>Mr McIver said locals and tourists should look out for the Goldtower Central logo in places they may not expect.</p>
            <p>“Stormwater grating has the Goldtower logo on every piece,” Mr McIver said.</p>
            <p>“It’s a great thing for people to look out for as many might not be aware of how much detail we put into the construction of Goldtower Central.”</p>
            <p>Mr McIver said he has made a concerted effort to give Goldtower Central a “5 star look.”</p>
            <p>"We’ve purchased 10,000 of those little silver, stainless steel tactiles,” he said.</p>
            <p>"Installation of each tactile has to be drilled into concrete, then glued into place.</p>
            <p>“Other developers opt for a sheet of tactiles which can be quickly and cheaply laid but we have chosen the individual option which gives a 5 star look and finish.</p>
            <p>“We are well planned ahead with 10,000 which should be more than enough for the whole precinct."</p>
            <p>Mr McIver also said every tile in Australia’s largest ceramic tiled mosaic at Goldtower Central was placed individually with two fingers and each one has 750,000 or more tiles.</p>
