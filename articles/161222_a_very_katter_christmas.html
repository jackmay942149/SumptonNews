            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published on 16/12/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>State MP Robbie Katter has discussed ongoing Christmas traditions in the Katter household.</p>
            <p>Mr Katter said Christmas was a great time to gather with his whole family.</p>
            <p>“My wife and I are based in big families,” he said.</p>
            <p>“You lead busy lives and you spread everywhere so it's the one time of year you know you all catch up.</p>
            <p>“You mightn’t see brothers and sisters all year but Christmas is when you try and get together.”</p>
            <p>Mr Katter said there were many traditions during Christmas once his family fully gathered.</p>
            <p>“Mum's modus operandi is to send everyone into a food coma by lunchtime and we're not good for much else for the rest of the day so you could probably do Christmas in half a day really,” he said.</p>
            <p>“The family is too big now, we’d all go broke buying presents so it's just a Secret Santa now, keep it a bit more punchy.</p>
            <p>“The only other thing that resembles a tradition is we've always played a game of touch football, ever since I was a kid.</p>
            <p>“Dad still plays surprisingly.” </p>
            <p>The member for Traeger also discussed his spiritual connection to Christmas.</p>
            <p>“I can pretty safely say I’ve never missed a Christmas mass in my life,” he said.</p>
            <p>“Through the younger years it was probably unhealthily coupled with visiting the White Horse Tavern beforehand and then going straight to Christmas mass.</p>
            <p>“At the end of the day you're celebrating the birth of Jesus, you're not celebrating the fact that you get presents.</p>
            <p>“You find more meaning looking for the meaning in things as you get older.</p>
            <p>“On a personal level, I’d say, that would describe me more now where you think more about the meaning of things.</p>
            <p>“It’s fair to say I probably would put a bit more of a spiritual element on it these days or the older I get.”</p>
