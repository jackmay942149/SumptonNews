            <h4>Entertainment Opinion - <em>Daniel Sumpton</em></h4>

            <p>Detective Pikachu was a smash hit for the 3DS in 2016 with the new and multi-layered main character, Tim Goodman alongside a chatty crime-solving Pikachu. </p>
            <p>The charm of the video game was not lost on the masses as it was soon developed into a blockbuster movie.</p>
            <p>The film came out in 2019 to praise from fans and critics alike. </p>
            <p>The movie had great visuals and a larger-than-life plot with the brilliant marketing decision of casting Ryan Reynolds as the lead Pokemon.</p>
            <p>With the indubitable success of the 3DS game and film, it was inevitable that we would see a sequel on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Detective Pikachu will be released on October 6th of this year and the game’s trailer has revealed many things to get excited over.</p>
            <p>The game will see the return of Kaiji Tang as the voice of the videogame version of Detective Pikachu, providing a gravelly policeman-like voice in contrast with how Ryan Reynolds portrays the character in the movie with a high pitch and irritated voice.</p>
            <p>Iconic lines from the lead Pokemon such as “The name’s Pikachu and I’m what you might call a great detective,” and “I sure wish somebody would bring me some coffee,” were dropped in the nearly minute and a half trailer on YouTube.</p>
            <p>The game also seems to be introducing more noir-inspired jazz music to enjoy while solving Poke problems. Blacksad and L.A Noire fans will probably enjoy this playful take on crime-fighting adventure.</p>
            <p>Mewtwo and Tim Goodman will also be returning for the Switch Sequel but there were plenty of new faces leaked as well. </p>
            <p>The new game will seem to have an emphasis on the Pokemon Slowpoke as there is a fountain with the character featured as well as a clip of a Slowpoke with a detective hat using a water attack.</p>
            <p>The game also looks visually stunning, with many smart stylized choices for the Nintendo Switch which will appeal to all kinds of ages and audiences. </p>
            <p>If you are a Pokemon fan in general or just a Detective Pikachu fan, you won’t want to miss out on this experience for the Nintendo Switch on October 6, 2023.</p>
            <p>Go solve Pokemon-related crime puzzles!</p>
