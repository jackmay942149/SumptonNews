            <h4><em>Xander Townsend</em> - Originally published for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Sales and Marketing for Agripower, the world’s largest producer of completely natural PAS* fertilisers, Peter Tandy has outlined why Charters Towers was the prime spot for an Agripower Plant.</p>
            <p>Agripower aims to increase soil health, soil fertility, better nutrient utilization, and water characteristics because their product helps in drought and plants under stress in order to increase farmer’s yields and benefit both the farm and the environment with a natural allowable organic input. </p>
            <p>Mr Tandy said Charters Towers was ideal for its community, location, and affordability.</p>
            <p>“Charters Towers has got a good community, It's got good resources, it's got everything from retail outlets for our product, as well as the infrastructure and community to be able to support our workforce,” he said.</p>
            <p>“It's not as large as Townsville, Townsville’s got a lot of military and a lot of transient population, the fly and fly out type of scenario, whereas we're more of a local operation. </p>
            <p>“From here, the land was cheaper than Townsville, etc, so we could get more land to build a sizable plant, and also in the future, this plant can produce 250,000 tons at capacity.</p>
            <p>“We want to be able to replicate that here on site, so obviously we need a big footprint.</p>
            <p>“If we were to get a big footprint in Townsville, it's gonna cost us 20 times the amount.”</p>
            <p>According to Mr Tandy, Charters Towers is great on both an agriculture level and a business level.</p>
            <p>“From a business perspective, it's a great place to operate and there's a lot of community support,” he said.</p>
            <p>“From an agriculture perspective, we are in the middle of or close to prime agricultural land."</p>
