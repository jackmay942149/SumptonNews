            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 14/4/23 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Co-owners of Babes Beer and Barra, Sam and Loretta Mahoney have been collecting donations for those devastated by recent major floods in the Gulf Country.</p>
            <p>Loretta Mahoney detailed the process of donating to victims of the floods.</p>
            <p>“Like everyone we saw the devastation on the TV and we just wanted to personally do something, whatever we could,” she said.</p>
            <p>“We decided just within ourselves that we would try and get some donations together.</p>
            <p>“Our friends in Cloncurry at the local roping club there were also trying to do something so we were going to coordinate something, but ours basically went from little things to big things.</p>
            <p>“We outgrew a horse float and we're in a 20 foot loaded container of donated goods.</p>
            <p>“It's been a community effort and we have had Townsville people also drop stuff off into a drop off point in Townsville.</p>
            <p>“Rural pumping solutions, Andrew Bambrick has very kindly donated his time and bought all donations from Townsville to Charters Towers.”</p>
            <p>Donations are expected to be delivered to flood victims in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>Federal MP Bob Katter spoke highly of Loretta Mahoney’s generous donation initiative.</p>
            <p>“People like Loretta Mahoney have provided more assistance than the State and Federal Governments,” he said.</p>
