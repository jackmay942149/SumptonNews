            <h4><em>Jack May</em> - Originally published on 18/11/2022 for the Charters Towers newspaper, Sumpton's Gold Rush Gazette.</h4>

            <p>Richie’s Night Markets at Richmond Hill State School took place on November 12 and was a huge success according to Deputy Principal, Lisa Pitt.</p>
            <p>Richie’s Night Markets serve as the annual P+C fundraiser for Richmond Hill State School and there were stalls, multiple raffles, and opportunities for donations.</p>
            <p>Ms Pitt said she was appreciative for all the support the night had received.</p>
            <p>“We are very fortunate now that COVID has restrictions lifted, we are very excited,” she said.</p>
            <p>“And to see the community come out when our team’s been working since 6:30 in the morning and to have it go from 4pm to 8pm is sensational.”</p>
            <p>Ms Pitt also said the support for state schools by the Charters Towers community has stayed strong over her 3 decade career.</p>
            <p>“Charters Towers community supports State Schools in Charters Towers, they support this annual event every year,” she said.</p>
